## Trunk-Based Development: Key Points

1. **Single Main Branch**: All developers commit to the trunk or main branch.
2. **Short-Lived Branches**: Branches, if used, are short-lived and quickly merged back.
3. **Frequent Integrations**: Code changes are integrated frequently, often multiple times a day.
4. **Feature Flags**: Incomplete features are managed with feature flags to maintain trunk stability.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Integration Problems**: Early conflict detection and resolution.
- **Higher Code Quality**: Continuous testing ensures stable and high-quality code.
- **Simpler Workflow**: Less overhead managing branches and merges.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Encourages teamwork and code reviews.

## Challenges

- **Discipline Required**: Developers must write clean, well-tested code.
- **Handling Incomplete Features**: Requires careful use of feature flags.

## Best Practices

- **Frequent Commits**: Small, incremental changes reduce integration risks.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated tests for codebase coverage.
- **Feature Flags**: Manage incomplete or experimental features.
- **Code Reviews**: Maintain quality and knowledge sharing.
